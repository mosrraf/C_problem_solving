fibonacci sequence: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,....
target: find sum of even numbers in the sequence
pseudo code:
	1-declare and initialize two integers previous at 1 and next at 2.
	2-declare and initialize sum at 0.
	3-if next is divisible by 2.
		add it to sum.
	4-declare and initialize temp to be previous+next.
	5-set previous to be next and next to be temp.
	6-loop from 3-5 till next exceeds 4000000.
	7-print the sum.
